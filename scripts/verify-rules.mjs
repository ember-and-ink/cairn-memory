/**
 * Checks that every `CLAUDE.md §N.M` reference in the repo resolves to a rule
 * that exists, and that its text still looks like what the citing file claims.
 * Also that every `docs/<page>.md` and `D-NNNN` reference names a page and a
 * decision that exist, so deleting a doc cannot leave pointers to nothing — and that
 * every source path a comment or doc cites (`pipeline/budgeter.js`) is a file, so a
 * module can be moved without leaving pointers behind.
 *
 * Rules are numbered, so inserting one silently shifts every reference after it
 * — which happened the first time a rule was added (CLAUDE.md §9.35: if a
 * mistake can be caught mechanically, catch it mechanically).
