/**
 * The assembler — builds the memory block from the tiers (DESIGN.md §11).
 *
 * P1's target is *where* a see-saw step breaks the prefix, not moving the block
 * down. The history is the part that grows, so anything below it shifts every
 * turn; the block stays high. What has to change is inside it: a step must
 * change the block's **tail**, not its head (docs/decisions.md D-0019).
 *
 * That falls out of three things, and only the third is in this file:
 *
 *   1. The growth cadence advances the threshold in steps, so between steps the
 *      included set is identical (pipeline/scheduler.js).
 *   2. The eviction cadence only drops summaries when the prompt genuinely
 *      cannot hold them, and then drops a batch (pipeline/budgeter.js).
 *   3. The block is rendered oldest-first, so growth appends and the bytes
 *      already in the prompt keep their offsets.
 *
 * Decoupled that way, a step turn adds to the end of a block whose head is
 * unchanged, and the first changed byte moves from the block's start to its end
 * — the 13% turn becomes a ~90% one, on D-0019's arithmetic.
 *
 * **The plan is made before the prompt is built, and used.** It runs in the
 * generate interceptor, the last hook that is still ahead of prompt assembly
 * (public/script.js:4564 against :4635), and prompt/injector.js writes it. What
 * it may write is the handover gate's decision (prompt/handover.js): until qvink
 * is silent, the plan is a measurement and nothing more (docs/decisions.md D-0020,
 * D-0027).
 *
 * **The plan is a function of the chat, not of what was measured.** The cap is
 * worked out from the chat and the settings (prompt/reserves.js) and every size is
 * counted from the block itself, so the same chat always gets the same block and
 * nothing learned last turn can bend this one (docs/decisions.md D-0033, D-0052).
