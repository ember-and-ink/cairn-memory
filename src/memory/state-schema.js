/**
 * Tier 1's shape: the fields and their caps, merging the model's record into ours,
 * and rendering it into the prompt (docs/decisions.md D-0043, D-0053).
 *
 * The fields are the hard facts a card's description fixes and the story later
 * changes: where the scene is, who is in it, their hair and outfit. Mood, time and
 * plot stay with the roleplay model, so the memory model never steers the story.
 *
 * The model sends the whole record every turn, so **a field is never cleared** — a
 * filled field is the nudge, and an empty one hands the card's stale value the
 * argument (D-0053). Fields merge, so anything the reply leaves out keeps its
 * bytes; the cast replaces, so who is present is whoever the reply lists.
 *
 * The caps bound the rendered state by construction. `mergeReply` only produces
 * values `validState` accepts, `renderState` renders nothing else, and the widest
 * valid state renders to MAX_STATE_CHARS. Nothing is clamped: a value over its cap
 * is dropped and the stored one kept.
 *
 * Pure: plain data in, new plain data out. Inputs are never mutated.
