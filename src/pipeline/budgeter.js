/**
 * The *eviction* cadence — the other half of D-0019, kept apart from the growth
 * cadence in scheduler.js on purpose.
 *
 * Eviction is the expensive event: it changes the block's first byte, so the
 * model re-reads the block and everything under it. qvink pays that price on
 * every see-saw step because its budget binds on every step. Cairn pays it only
 * when the block outgrows its cap, and then pays it *once* for many steps by
 * dropping down to a floor rather than shaving the single summary that happened
 * to overflow.
 *
 * Three numbers, all worked out from the chat and the settings rather than
 * measured turn to turn (docs/decisions.md D-0033):
 *
 *   `cap`      — the smaller of `CAP_FRACTION` of the max prompt and the room the
 *                rest of the prompt leaves, never below `MIN_CAP_FRACTION`
 *                (docs/decisions.md D-0038, D-0052). No setting, and nothing
 *                measured feeds it.
 *   `sceneCap` — what is left of it once canon has taken its share
 *                (`canonCap`, docs/decisions.md D-0056). This is what the summaries
 *                are fitted to; the cap above is the whole block's.
 *   `floor`    — where a rebuild lands. Half the scene cap, so the next rebuild is
 *                half a cap of growth away instead of one summary away (D-0026).
 *
 * The mark only ever moves forward within a session, which is what makes the
 * deferral hold. A reload starts it over: the first turn of a session rebuilds
 * the block anyway, so it lands at the floor too and buys the full slack.
 *
 * **The deferral is conditional and the condition is checkable.** Rebuilds are
 * spaced `(sceneCap - floor) / growth-per-step` steps apart, so a cap only a step
 * or two wide puts eviction back on every step — qvink's behaviour, reached by a
 * longer road. `recoupled()` says when that has happened (CLAUDE.md §9.35).
 *
 * Pure but for one index of state. No ST, no DOM, no network.
