# Development

Cairn ships as raw browser ES modules with no build step. SillyTavern loads only
what `manifest.json` lists; `package.json` is dev tooling and never reaches the
browser.

## Setup

```sh
make install     # npm ci
make help        # every target
```

## The gate

```sh
make check       # lint + version-check + verify-rules + tests + secrets + verify-st
```

CI runs all of it except `verify-st`, which needs a SillyTavern checkout that CI
does not have. Every CI step exists here under the same target name — if you can
run `make check`, you know what CI will say.

| Target | |
|---|---|
| `make lint` | ESLint over the browser modules |
| `make test` | Vitest, once |
| `make test-watch` | Vitest, watching |
| `make version-check` | `manifest.json` and `package.json` versions agree |
| `make bump` | Minor bump in `manifest.json` and `package.json`; `PART=patch` or `PART=major` to override |
| `make verify-st` | Re-check `docs/st-api-surface.md` against a local ST |
| `make verify-rules` | Every `CLAUDE.md §N.M`, `docs/<page>.md`, `D-NNNN` and cited source path (`pipeline/budgeter.js`) still resolves |

## Dependency updates

Dependabot opens one PR a week covering npm and the pinned actions together, and
`dependabot-automerge.yml` merges it once the required checks are green. Security
updates arrive separately, one PR per ecosystem, and merge the same way.

These PRs do not bump the version: npm here is dev tooling and nothing it
installs ships, so there is nothing to release. The `Version` check skips its
bump comparison for them and still enforces that `manifest.json` and
`package.json` agree. A red Dependabot PR is the only one that needs a human.

## Releases

`release.yml` runs on every push to `main`. If the `manifest.json` version has
no release yet, it tags that commit with the bare version (`1.2.0`, no `v`) and
creates a GitHub release whose notes are GitHub's generated list of PRs merged
since the previous one. If it already exists, it does nothing.

Dependabot merges never trigger it (they don't bump the version, and a
`GITHUB_TOKEN` merge doesn't fire `push`). Their PRs show up in the next
release's notes instead. To retry a failed run, use *Run workflow* on the
Actions tab.

## Working against a local SillyTavern

Symlink the repo into your ST extensions directory so edits are live:

```sh
ln -s ~/workspaces/cairn-memory \
  ~/workspaces/SillyTavern/data/default-user/extensions/cairn-memory
```

The folder name matters — it is the template path in
`src/constants.js` (`third-party/cairn-memory`).

`make verify-st` defaults to `~/workspaces/SillyTavern`; override with
`make verify-st ST_PATH=/path/to/SillyTavern`.

## Testing

Everything under `src/` that we test is pure logic — no DOM, no ST, no network.
If a module cannot be tested that way, the ST coupling is in the wrong place.

- `test/mocks/sillytavern.js` — the ST surface, mirroring the real shapes. Every
  field cites the `file:line` it was taken from. It is a deliberate *subset*: an
  unlisted field means we have not declared that dependency yet.
- `test/mocks/llm.js` — the memory model, including `badOutputs`: fenced JSON,
  preamble chatter, truncation, refusals, schema violations, leaked reasoning.
  Parsers are tested against these, because this is what mid-tier models
  actually return.
- `test/mocks/qvink.js` — qvink-memory's `message.extra` shape: the per-message
  summary records the scene reader parses, with the flags that decide what it
  would have injected. Shape confirmed against the corpus, content invented.
- `test/mocks.test.js` — guards the mocks themselves. A mock that has drifted
  from ST is worse than no mock; it makes broken code pass.

**Fixtures are synthetic in content, real in shape.** This repo is public, so no
real chat logs, character cards, personas or names land in it — anywhere. But a
fixture whose structure was invented only proves the test agrees with our guess,
so the shape is confirmed against real captured chats first and the fixture says
which real shape it mirrors. The corpus lives outside the repo at
`~/workspaces/cairn-corpus`. Nothing in this repo modifies or deletes what is there;
a calibration pass may add derived files under a directory of its own (below).

## Adding a SillyTavern dependency

1. Find it in the checkout and read it. Do not assume a signature.
2. Add a row to `docs/st-api-surface.md` with the `file:line`.
3. Mirror the shape in `test/mocks/sillytavern.js`, citing the same line.
4. `make verify-st`.

## Changing a stored shape

Anything written into `message.extra` or `chatMetadata` is someone's accumulated
memory. A change to its shape needs:

1. A version bump in `src/store/schema.js`.
2. A migration registered alongside it.
3. A test fixture of the **old** shape, proving the migration loads it.
4. A `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

## Reading a run

With **Log each generation to disk** on (the default), every observed generation
appends a flat JSON line to that chat's own file:

```
~/workspaces/SillyTavern/data/default-user/user/files/cairn-<chat>-<id>.jsonl
```

`<chat>` is the chat's name flattened to the characters ST accepts, and `<id>` is
a hash of the real name, so two chats never share a file. A chat played over
several sessions is one trail: every line carries `chat_id` and `session` (when
that page load began), so a sitting's lines are `select(.session == …)`.

One line per generation, with `stability_percent`, `prompt_tokens`,
`injected_tokens`, `writers`, the per-injection breakdown and the divergence
excerpts. To watch the stability curve of a session:

```sh
jq -r '[.session, .api, .stability_percent, .prompt_tokens, .writers] | @tsv' \
  ~/workspaces/SillyTavern/data/default-user/user/files/cairn-<chat>-<id>.jsonl
```

Every memory call gets a line of its own too, `"kind": "call"`, in the order it
happened (D-0093). A generation line has no `kind`. A call line says which `job`
it was (`summary`, `state`, `index`, `canon`), which `message` it was for, and
`during` (`queue`, `adopt`, `redo`). It also has the `outcome` (`written`, `failed`,
`discarded`, `unsettled`), the `reason` and `attempt` for a failure, the transport
`error`, `ms`, `tokens_in`/`tokens_out` (ST's tokenizer, a size and not a bill),
`reply_chars` and `model`. A structured call (`state`, `index`, `canon`) that failed
because its reply could not be read also keeps where it broke (D-0094): `reply_error`
(the parse error, or null when the JSON parsed and only its shape was wrong),
`reply_at` (the offset), `reply_near` (80 characters either side) and `reply_tail`
(the last 80). That is the only model text the log holds. To see what failed:

```sh
jq -c 'select(.kind == "call" and .outcome != "written") | [.at, .during, .job, .message, .outcome, .reason, .error, .reply_error, .reply_near]' \
  ~/workspaces/SillyTavern/data/default-user/user/files/cairn-<chat>-<id>.jsonl
```

ST's endpoint replaces files rather than appending, so the first write of a
session reads the file back and each write after carries what was already there.
If the read-back fails, nothing is written that session rather than risk replacing
the trail. `cairn-inspector.jsonl` is where lines went before this, and where one
goes if no chat is open.

## Calibrating against real summaries

Some numbers can only come from real chats, and their answers must not land in this
public repo. [`scripts/calibrate-tier.mjs`](../scripts/calibrate-tier.mjs) is the
harness for that, in two steps because the middle one is a model:

```sh
node scripts/calibrate-tier.mjs extract "<chat>.jsonl"   # → corpus/p5-stage0/summaries.{json,md}
#   a model reads summaries.md and writes records.json beside it
node scripts/calibrate-tier.mjs measure                  # → report.md and chain.md
```

It opens the chat read-only, writes only under `~/workspaces/cairn-corpus/p5-stage0`,
and **refuses any output path inside the repo**. It imports the shipped `renderRecord`
and `estimateTokens`, so the cost it reports is the cost the block would pay. P5 stage
0c is what it was written for (`docs/decisions.md` D-0076); `measure` re-runs whenever
the record shape or the summary prompt changes.

**Comparing models** is the same two steps with a different writer of `records.json`:
keep the reference pass, write the candidate's beside it, and diff the two reports. The
models that matter are the ones a memory profile actually points at — the GLM / Kimi /
DeepSeek class — not the one that wrote the reference.

[`scripts/run-tier.mjs`](../scripts/run-tier.mjs) does that end to end against any
OpenAI-compatible API (nano-gpt by default): the six index batches, `assemble`,
`measure`, then the canon pick and `pick-gate.mjs score`, into a fresh
`p5-stage0/0d/<model>/run-N/` each time.

```sh
echo 'NANOGPT_API_KEY=...' > .env                    # gitignored; the script loads it
node scripts/run-tier.mjs <model...> --smoke         # one batch each, parsed — does the model answer at all
node scripts/run-tier.mjs <model...> --runs 3        # three full passes each, for the spread
```

`NANOGPT_BASE_URL` points it elsewhere, and one model failing does not stop the rest. Every call's usage and raw reply is kept in the
run's `calls.jsonl`. The verdict against `yardstick.md` is still a read, not a number.

## Driving a long run

A phase gate wants tens of unattended turns.
[`scripts/autoplay.user.js`](../scripts/autoplay.user.js) is a Tampermonkey
userscript that plays them. It is a dev harness: `manifest.json` does not load it
and it ships with nothing.

Install it in Tampermonkey, adjust `@match` if SillyTavern is not on port 8181,
and keep **`@grant none`** — the script needs page context to reach
`globalThis.SillyTavern` (`public/scripts/st-context.js:115`). An overlay appears
bottom-right with the turn count, a settle delay and a Run/Pause toggle.

One turn in `impersonate` mode is `/impersonate await=true`, which leaves the
generated user line in `#send_textarea` (`public/script.js:5524`), then a click on
`#send_but`, which is the path a hand-played turn takes
(`public/script.js:11160`). Completion is read from `chat.length` growing by two,
then from ST clearing `document.body.dataset.generating`
(`public/script.js:7088`). `continue` mode runs `/continue await=true` instead.

Two things to hold in mind when reading the log afterwards:

- **A turn is two generations.** Cairn's interceptor skips only quiet prompts
  (`src/prompt/injector.js:106`), so the impersonation gets the memory block too
  and is logged alongside the story generation. Size a run by its events, not by
  the turn counter.
- **The settle delay does not know about Cairn.** It is a fixed sleep, not a wait
  on the summariser's queue draining, so a long backlog can still be in flight
  when the next turn starts. Raise the delay if `pending` is climbing.

## House rules

[`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) is the full set and takes precedence over habit.
